    <p>These are all the things that Mozilla wants from me: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HERT N SOUL</strong></li>
        <li>Attention</li>
        <li>Soul</li>
        <li>E-mail</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They didn't actually ask for any of that. I don't even know if there is a way to give my e-mail to them, or if
        they would even want it.

        This webpage will be a testament to the power of...er...jiu-jitsu? I don't know. It's just for something to do. 
        I have rushed through tutorials without reading the documentation for the frameworks/languages that I've used, and I 
        don't think it's served me well. So I'm going to be patient, and take my sweet-ass pimp time going through Mozilla's 
        tutorials. They seem to be very thurough, and I'd like to learn these languages thuroughly.
